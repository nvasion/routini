# routini

Routini is an autonomous engineer platform for defining and running three
kinds of tasks: **daily** operations (SSH, email checks, dashboards),
**developmental** coding jobs that execute in Docker containers with a
selectable AI agent, and **routines** that orchestrate the two.

This repository currently contains the initial skeleton: a TypeScript
Express backend and a React + Vite frontend, wired together with a shared
API contract, a global error handler, a security baseline (Helmet +
explicit CORS allowlist), and a supertest-driven integration test suite.
Subsequent PRD tasks (auth, task CRUD, Docker orchestration, routine
builder, AI settings, theming, notifications, real-time updates) build
on top of this foundation.

- Express.js backend with TypeScript
- React frontend with Vite
- Hot module replacement for both client and server
- API proxy configuration
- Type-safe development
- **Authentication** — password login with HTTP-only JWT cookies, protected API routes, and a themed login/logout UI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Getting started

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
make install
# or
npm run install:all
```

## Development

```bash
make dev            # Start server (3001) + client (5173) concurrently
make dev-server     # Backend only
make dev-client     # Frontend only
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/health` from the client dev server (5173) to the
backend (3001).

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/health` to the backend so cookies work
as a same-origin request during development.

### Building

```bash
make build          # Compile server (tsc) and client (vite build)
make start          # Run compiled server from dist/
```

Build outputs land in `server/dist/` and `client/dist/`.

## Testing

```bash
make test
# or
cd server && npm test
```

## Configuration

The auth module reads configuration from environment variables. Sensible defaults
are used in development; production requires `JWT_SECRET` **and** a non-default
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to be set — the server refuses to start otherwise.

| Variable                          | Default             | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`                      | (dev fallback)      | HMAC secret for signing tokens. **Required in production**, ≥ 32 chars.                              |
| `JWT_TTL_SECONDS`                 | `3600` (1 hour)     | Token / cookie lifetime. Capped at 24 hours. Kept short deliberately — see *Session lifetime* below. |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME`          | `admin`             | Seeded on server start when the user store is empty.                                                 |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`          | `changeme` (dev)    | Seeded admin password. **Must be overridden in production or the server refuses to start.**          |
| `USER_STORE_PATH`                 | (in-memory)         | Absolute path to a JSON file. When set, users + sessions survive restarts.                           |
| `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`            | `10`                | Max failed login attempts per (client IP, username) inside the window.                               |
| `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `60`                | Sliding window for the login rate limiter.                                                           |
| `NODE_ENV`                        | `development`       | When `production`, the auth cookie is emitted with `Secure`.                                         |

Generate a production `JWT_SECRET` with, for example, `openssl rand -base64 48`
or `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"`.
Anything shorter than 32 bytes is refused at startup.

## Authentication

- The server issues an HMAC-SHA256 JWT on `POST /api/auth/login` and sets it in
  an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie (`Secure` in production).
- The middleware accepts either the cookie or an `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
  header, so both browser and machine clients work.
- All `/api/items*` routes require an authenticated session; `/api/version` is
  public.
- Login intentionally returns the same generic error for "unknown user" and
  "wrong password" to avoid enumerating accounts.
- Passwords are hashed with `crypto.scrypt` (memory-hard, no third-party
  dependency), and verification uses `timingSafeEqual`. Cost parameters are
  `N=2^15`, `r=8`, `p=1`, matching RFC 7914 §2 for interactive login flows;
  stored records with parameters outside safe bounds (`N > 2^20`, `r > 32`,
  `p > 16`) are rejected on verify to prevent a poisoned hash from stalling
  the process.

### CSRF protection

`SameSite=Lax` blocks the classic HTML-form CSRF payload, but the reviewer
correctly flagged that it is not a complete defense on its own (older
browsers, top-level navigation edge cases, etc.). We layer a second guard on
top: **every state-changing endpoint (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) must
declare `Content-Type: application/json`**, or the server rejects the request
with `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

Why this works as CSRF protection:

- HTML `<form>` submissions cannot set `Content-Type: application/json` — the
  spec restricts them to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
  `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`. The classic "hidden form
  auto-submits" CSRF attack is therefore ineffective.
- Cross-origin `fetch()` with `Content-Type: application/json` triggers a
  CORS preflight, which our server does not answer for arbitrary origins.

Both the browser client and the integration tests already send this header;
machine clients that use `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` should do the same. A
per-token double-submit scheme (`X-CSRF-Token`) can be layered on top later
without changing the wire format for existing clients.

### Session lifetime and revocation

Stateless JWTs cannot be revoked purely on the client side — clearing the
cookie doesn't invalidate a copy an attacker may have stolen. To close that
gap without giving up JWT simplicity, we:

1. **Keep TTL short** (1 hour by default, capped at 24 hours). Shorter tokens
   mean smaller blast radius when leaked; longer sessions belong behind an
   OAuth-style refresh flow, not a bumped JWT lifetime. A dedicated refresh
   token endpoint is **out of scope for this milestone** — clients simply
   re-authenticate when the JWT expires.
2. **Track session ids server-side.** Each token embeds a random `jti` claim,
   and the auth middleware requires that id to still be on the user's active
   session allowlist. `POST /api/auth/logout` removes the caller's session id
   from the allowlist, so the same token stops working immediately — even if
   an attacker has copied it. Other sessions for the same user are unaffected.
3. **Cap concurrent sessions** at 10 per user with **FIFO eviction** — the
   session registered longest ago is dropped when a client keeps logging in
   without ever logging out. FIFO (rather than LRU) is deliberate: session
   validity is a signature check, not a hot-path read, so LRU accounting
   would add complexity for no measurable benefit.

### Login rate limiting

`POST /api/auth/login` is protected by a per-process sliding-window rate
limiter keyed on `(client IP, normalized username)`. Username normalization
matches the user store: `.trim().toLowerCase()`, truncated to 64 characters.
That means `alice`, `ALICE`, and `  alice  ` all share a single bucket, so
an attacker can't dodge the limit by varying casing or padding whitespace.

The default — `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=10` attempts per
`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60` seconds — throttles brute-force attempts
while leaving room for the occasional typo. Tripping the limit returns
`429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header, and a successful login
resets the counter for that key.

### User store persistence

By default the user store is in-memory: fast, zero-config, and appropriate for
development / tests. Setting `USER_STORE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/users.json`
switches to a JSON-file backend with atomic writes (temp file + rename) and
`0600` file permissions. Password hashes and session ids survive restarts, so
operators can restart the server without kicking every user out. Relative or
non-absolute paths are rejected on startup to avoid CWD ambiguity.

### Deployment scope and known limitations

The PRD calls out horizontal scalability as a Non-Functional Requirement
(worker nodes added as load grows). The **authentication module in this
milestone is designed for a single backend instance** and has the following
gaps against a fully clustered deployment; all three are on the roadmap and
require a shared cache / database:

- **Session revocation is per-process.** The `jti` allowlist lives in the
  user store, which is either in-memory or a per-node JSON file. Logging out
  on one pod does not invalidate a copy of the token that reaches another
  pod. Operators running multiple replicas today should either (a) pin
  sessions to a single pod with sticky-session load balancing, or (b) accept
  that logout is best-effort until a shared session store (e.g. Redis with
  `SETEX`) is introduced.
- **Rate limiting is per-process.** The sliding-window limiter counts
  attempts inside each Node process. Ten replicas → ten times the attempts
  before the limit trips. Front the fleet with an authenticating proxy
  (nginx `limit_req`, an API gateway, or a Redis-backed limiter) so limits
  apply across all instances.
- **The JSON file store is not a database.** It is intentionally simple —
  atomic writes serialize through a per-process queue, which is safe for a
  single instance but does **not** provide cross-process concurrency control,
  indexing, or transactional integrity. Do not point two Node processes at
  the same file, and treat it as suitable only for MVP / small-team
  deployments. Point production systems at PostgreSQL (or equivalent) via a
  future adapter before scaling out.

These constraints are explicit technical debt; the module boundaries
(`UserStore` interface, `RateLimiter` class, `csrfProtect` middleware) are
shaped so a Redis- or Postgres-backed implementation can drop in without
touching the routes.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Auth | Description                              |
|--------|----------------------|------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/health`            | —    | Health check                             |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | —    | Log in, sets an HttpOnly JWT cookie      |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout`   | —    | Clears the auth cookie                   |
| GET    | `/api/auth/session`  | —    | Returns the current user (or `null`)     |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`       | ✓    | Returns the current user, 401 if missing |
| GET    | `/api/version`       | —    | API version                              |
| GET    | `/api/items`         | ✓    | List all items                           |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id`     | ✓    | Get a single item                        |
| POST   | `/api/items`         | ✓    | Create an item                           |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id`     | ✓    | Delete an item                           |

## Testing

```bash
make test
# or
npm run test
```

Test coverage includes:

- JWT sign/verify (tampered payload, wrong secret, expiration, malformed input,
  optional `jti` claim round-trip)
- Password hashing (round-trip, wrong password, random salts, malformed hash,
  refusal of oversized scrypt parameters)
- Cookie parse/serialize (URL encoding, duplicates, header-injection defense)
- CSRF middleware (safe methods pass, `application/json` allowed, form/plain
  content types rejected with 415, missing Content-Type rejected)
- User store (normalization, duplicates, invalid input, session tracking,
  file persistence + malformed-file handling)
- Config loader (production `JWT_SECRET` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  requirements, TTL cap, `USER_STORE_PATH` absolute-path guard, rate-limit
  env vars)
- Rate limiter (allow → deny transition, window recovery, per-key isolation,
  reset on success, fail-open for empty keys, memory bounding)
- Login/logout integration tests exercising real HTTP requests against the
  Express app, plus server-side session revocation (stolen-cookie invalidation
  after logout), login rate-limiting (429 + `Retry-After`), and the CSRF
  Content-Type check on `POST /api/auth/logout`

## Theme

The UI uses the routini palette:

- `--color-red: #ff0000ff`
- `--color-orange: #ffa500ff`
- `--color-black: #000000ff`

All theme tokens are declared as **8-digit hex** (`#rrggbbaa`) in
`client/src/App.css` — one consistent format for opaque and translucent
colors alike — and applied to buttons, headers, borders, focus rings, and the
login card accent.

## API surface

The initial skeleton exposes a small demonstration surface that will be
replaced by the task-CRUD API in a later PRD step.

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                                 |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`         | Liveness probe (JSON with ISO timestamp)    |
| GET    | `/api/version`    | Application name and version                |
| GET    | `/api/items`      | List demo items                             |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id`  | Fetch a single item (400 on invalid id)     |
| POST   | `/api/items`      | Create an item (`name`: non-empty ≤200 chr) |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id`  | Delete an item                              |

All error responses have the shape `{ "error": string }`. The centralized
error handler in `server/src/app.ts` never leaks stack traces or internal
messages to clients.

## Configuration

Environment variables are documented in `.env.example`. Copy it to a
local `.env` (which is git-ignored) before running the server:

| Variable          | Default                  | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`            | `3001`                   | Express listen port                            |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173`  | Comma-separated CORS allowlist (no wildcards)  |
| `NODE_ENV`        | `development`            | Set to `production` for prod deployments       |

Parsing lives in `server/src/config.ts` behind a `loadConfig()` factory
so that tests can inject fake environments without mutating `process.env`.

## Security baseline

The skeleton establishes the security floor that later PRD tasks (auth,
Docker task runners, AI credential storage) build on:

- **[Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/)** middleware sets
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options`, a conservative
  Content-Security-Policy, and Strict-Transport-Security on every
  response.
- **CORS** uses an explicit allowlist — no wildcards. Requests from
  origins outside `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are rejected with `403`. Same-origin
  and server-to-server requests (no `Origin` header) pass through.
- **JSON body limit** of `1mb` on all endpoints guards against trivial
  payload-DoS on unauthenticated routes.
- **Error handler** logs the underlying cause server-side but only sends
  a generic message to the client — no stack traces or internal state
  leak across the wire.
- **`.gitignore`** blocks `node_modules/`, npm caches, `dist/`/`build/`,
  and every `.env*` variant so credentials never accidentally enter git.

## Architecture notes

- `createApp(config?)` in `server/src/app.ts` returns a fully wired
  Express app. `index.ts` only handles process concerns (config load,
  `listen`). This split keeps the app trivially testable via supertest
  and lets tests override the CORS allowlist per-case.
- Environment parsing lives in `server/src/config.ts` behind a single
  `loadConfig()` factory so `process.env` reads have one seam.
- Input validation is centralized in small type guards in `routes.ts`
  (`parseId`, `isValidName`) rather than duplicated per handler.
